## Slides for my presentation: 'Introduction to Git for Scientists'

![Fig1](./preview_git_introduction_for_scientists_slides.jpg?raw=true "Preview of the presentation slides for 'Introduction to Git for Scientists'.")

This is an in-depth introduction to the version control system Git for scientists. The slides are designed for a longer talk: expect about 60 to 90 minutes, depending on your presentation speed and the number of questions from the audience. You can hide various subsets of slides to shorten the talk or shift the focus.

The slides are not meant to be used for a workshop, where participants do exercises and actually use git during the presentation. You could of course add exercises.

The slides show git via the command line interface (as opposed to some graphical Git client or a specific IDE), but they focuses on concepts, not commands. The intention is to show scientists what git can do for them, but also be honest about its complexities. Therefore, they show some technical details, though always with the purpose of illustrating how things work in order to enable users to solve typical newcomer problems (e.g., first conflicts, working with undos locally and remotely).

## Slides

The slides are available in the following formats:

* [Introduction to Git for Scientists in Open Office Impress Format (.odp)](./Git_Introduction_for_Scientists.odp)
* [Introduction to Git for Scientists in Microsoft Office Format (.pptx)](./Git_Introduction_for_Scientists.pptx)
* [Introduction to Git for Scientists in Portable Document Format (.pdf)](./Git_Introduction_for_Scientists.pdf)

Please note that some slides are hidden by default, which is not represented in the PDF version. I would therefore recommend to use the ODP version.
