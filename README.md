## Slides for my presentation: 'Introduction to Git for Scientists'

This is an in-depth introduction to the version control system Git for scientists. The slides are designed for a longer talk: expect about 60 to 90 minutes, depending on your presentation speed and the number of questions from the audience.

The slides are not meant to be used for a workshop, where participants do exercises and actually use git during the talk, it's really just a talk.

It shows git via the command line interface, but it focuses on concepts, not commands. The intention is to show scientists what git can do for them, but also be honest about its complexities. Therefore, they show some technical details, though always with the purpose of illustrating how things work in order to enable users to solve typical newcomer problems (first conflicts, working with undos local and remote) can be solved.
